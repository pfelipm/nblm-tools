## 🔒 Privacy & Security

Privacy is at the core of this extension. NotebookLM Organizer is built following the **principle of least privilege**:

- **No Content Access:** The extension **never** reads, accesses, or processes the content of your notes, documents, or sources within your notebooks.
- **Organizational Metadata Only:** It only detects the **notebook name, source count, and creation date**. This data is used strictly to identify the notebook and link it to your tags.
- **No Data Manipulation:** The extension does not modify or manipulate your notebooks in any way. It only adds a visual organization layer on top of the existing Google UI.
- **Your Data is Yours:** All configurations are stored in your Google account (via Chrome Sync), and only you have access to them.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🏷️ **Color-Coded Tags:** Create custom tags with a vibrant color palette to categorize your projects visually.
- 🔍 **Advanced Filtering:** Find notebooks instantly by combining text search and tag filters with **AND** or **OR** logic.
- 🔄 **Automatic Sync:** Your tags and preferences are automatically synced across all your devices via your Chrome account.
- 💾 **Granular Backup:** Export and import your settings in JSON format, allowing you to choose which elements to restore.
- 🌐 **Multi-language Support:** Interface fully localized in **English, Spanish, and Catalan**, with instant language switching from the UI.
- 💡 **Featured Notebooks Handling:** For cleanliness and convenience, the extension hides the limited preview of featured notebooks in the main "All" tab and automatically disables itself when entering the dedicated "Featured" tab.
- ⚡ **Native Interface:** Designed to provide an extended organization and search experience that feels like a native NotebookLM feature, without disrupting your workflow.

## ⚠️ Important Note on List View

Since NotebookLM does not expose internal unique identifiers in all its views, the extension uses a metadata-based "fingerprint" to identify each notebook.

If you have multiple notebooks with the **same name, same number of sources, and same date**, the extension will detect a **collision** in the list view and block tagging for safety to avoid association errors. In these cases, a warning icon (⚠️) will appear, and you should use the **thumbnail view** (grid) to tag them, as that view allows for retrieving a real unique identifier.
